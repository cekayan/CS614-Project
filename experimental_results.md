## 4. Stain Normalization Impact Analysis

### Simple Stain Transfer Experiment (Reinhard Only)

| Configuration | Train Acc | Val Acc | Test Acc | Test F1 | Effect |
|---------------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| **None (Baseline)** | 78.42% | 67.44% | **76.92%** | 53.54% | - |
| **Reinhard Normalized** | 75.68% | 63.57% | **74.36%** | 52.50% | **-2.56%** |

**Stain Normalization Effect:**
- **Reinhard normalization reduced accuracy by 2.56%**
- Consistent degradation across train/val/test splits
- **Conclusion: Stain normalization was detrimental in this cross-domain scenario**

### Why Stain Normalization Failed:
1. **Severe Information Loss**: Color transformation removed discriminative features
2. **Inappropriate Domain Matching**: Breast tissue ‚â† Bone tissue staining patterns
3. **Tissue Type Mismatch**: Different tissue architectures require different color information
4. **Feature Degradation**: Normalized images lost important textural details
