# CS614 Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification

This repository contains comprehensive experiments on **cross-disease transfer learning** for histopathology image classification, specifically focusing on transfer from breast cancer (BreakHis) to bone cancer (Osteosarcoma) datasets. This work provides empirical validation of transfer learning strategies in computational pathology.

## üéØ Research Objective

We address two critical challenges in computational pathology:
1. **Limited labeled data** in many cancer types
2. **Strong domain shift** across laboratories, stains, and diseases

Our study compares direct training versus cross-disease transfer learning, evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies when morphological differences exist between source and target domains.

## üèÜ Key Findings

### Performance Results
- **Best Overall Performance**: MobileNetV2 Direct Training - **96.12% validation, 95.73% test accuracy**
- **Best Cross-Domain Transfer**: ResNet50 Full CNN Transfer - **93.16% test accuracy**
- **Most Robust Cross-Domain Model**: DenseNet121 - **91.45% accuracy**

### Critical Insights
- **Cross-disease transfer trails direct training by 3-10%** depending on backbone and strategy
- **Full network transfer significantly outperforms partial fine-tuning** for cross-domain scenarios
- **Stain normalization consistently degrades performance** (7-17% accuracy loss) when tissues differ in architecture
- **Feature-level alignment yields 3-8% improvements** over basic transfer learning

## üìä Experimental Design

### Datasets
- **Source Domain**: BreakHis (Breast cancer histopathology)
  - 7,909 images, 2 classes (Benign vs Malignant)
- **Target Domain**: Osteosarcoma (Bone cancer histopathology)  
  - 867 images, 3 classes (Non-tumor, Necrosis, Viable-tumor)

### CNN Architectures Evaluated
- **ResNet50** (23.5M parameters)
- **MobileNetV2** (2.2M parameters) - Best efficiency/accuracy trade-off
- **DenseNet121** (7.0M parameters) - Most robust to domain shift

### Transfer Learning Strategies
1. **Direct Training**: Train from scratch on target dataset (baseline)
2. **Partial Fine-tuning**: Freeze early layers, train last N layers  
3. **Full CNN Transfer**: Train entire CNN on source, use as feature extractor
4. **Feature-level Alignment**: Adjust normalization layers during fine-tuning

### Domain Adaptation Techniques
- **Image-level**: Stain normalization (Reinhard method)
- **Feature-level**: Batch/Layer/Instance normalization, Moment matching
